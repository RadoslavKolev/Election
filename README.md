Simple full stack decentralized application, named "Election", the purpose of which is to let 1 user to vote for one of two candidates - Donald Trump or Joe Biden. The user can vote one at a time and the application updates right away (after refresh). That means that the decentralized application is in real-time.

I used Solidity for the back-end and vanilla JavaScript + HTML5 and Bootstrap 3 for the frond-end.

The projects purpose was to train my skills as a blockchain developer, when I used to work for Quanterall in 2021.
